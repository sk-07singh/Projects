# Customer Support Chatbot

This project involves building and training a transformer-based model to generate automated responses to customer support queries.
The model is trained on a dataset of customer queries and responses using the GPT-2 architecture.
The project also includes an interactive demo for generating responses to user queries.

# Results
The trained model generates relevant and coherent responses to customer queries. Evaluation metrics indicate good performance, 
and the interactive demo allows users to test the model's capabilities.
